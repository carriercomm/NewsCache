Introduction
************

   NewsCache is a free cache server for USENET News. NewsCache acts to
news reading clients like a news server, except that it stores only
those articles that have been requested by at least one client.
NewsCache targets problems of the current News System like network
bandwidth consumption or the IO load caused by news clients.

   NewsCache can be used in combination with a news server. In this
setup news reading clients are connected to NewsCache instead of to the
news server.  In a small test at our university, we got a hit rate of
over 30%, although the interests of the people accessing NewsCache was
relatively wide spread.  This figure can be mapped onto a reduction of
the load at the news server.

   NewsCache can also replace leaf node news servers, if not all of the
articles are permanently accessed by news clients. NewsCache only stores
those newsgroups and articles being accessed frequently, while still
providing a virtual full feed. This reduces the network bandwidth
between the former news server and the news feed and also hardware
requirements (both in terms of disk space and CPU performance).  Less
CPU performance is sufficient because no local article numbering has to
be performed and a smaller database has to be searched.

   NewsCache can also be used for the provision of local newsgroups
without setting up and maintaining a news server with a full feed.
Instead you set up a news server holding only your local newsgorups and
let NewsCache multiplex between those news servers.

   In the rest of this document, we will explain, how NewsCache can be
configured for different operation environments.

Compatibility
*************

   NewsCache has been tested in combination with several news readers
and servers.

News Readers
============

   The following news readers have been reported to work in combination
with NewsCache: gnus, knews, MS Internet Mail and News, MS Outlook
Express, netscape, pine, slrn, tin, xrn.

   MS Internet Explorer für Windows 3.1, Version 3.01.2723 should work
starting from NewsCache Version 0.99.12. However, this version of
Internet Explorer retrieves articles by their article id and this
version of NewsCache does not cache articles retrieved by their article
identifier.

Article Reinstatement Bug
-------------------------

   Some news readers mark deleted articles as read. However, if the
article is reinstated on the news server, the article is still marked
as read and the user will never see this article as unread.  According
to RFC977, (Network News Transfer Protocol) (http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc977.txt) it is allowed that deleted articles
are reinstated. This is also documented in the new NNTP-draft which
should be published as RFC within the next months.

   This bug can only occur if NewsCache cannot connect to its news
server.  The following gives a scenario when this can happen, which is
mainly the case in offline mode.

  1. A client requests the active database from NewsCache. (The active
     database is a list of all the available newsgroups and their low
     and high watermarks.)

  2. The client selects a newsgroup and requests its overview database.

  3. However, the link between NewsCache and its news server is down
     and thus NewsCache cannot provide the overview records for all the
     articles.

  4. The client assumes that all the articles without overview record
     have been deleted and marks those as read.

News Servers
============

   All news servers that provide an overview database should work in
combination with NewsCache. Tested news servers are: INN, Microsoft's
News server, AMU News under VMS. In fact NewsCache should work with
every News Server that supports the `list', `group', `listgroup',
`[x]over', `article' commands.

General Configuration Options
*****************************

   No matter which configuration you use, I recommend to set up a
separate user for NewsCache, although I took care of security issues,
when writing NewsCache. *A service that needs not to run as priviledged
user, should not run as priviledged user.*

   First of all, you should specify, which configuration version, you
are using. The current version is version 5. Thus, you should include
the following line at the beginning of your `newscache.conf'-file:

     ConfigVersion 5

   NewsCache can be started either as `standalone' server or from
`inetd'. Using a standalone server has the advantage that the
configuration file will be read only at the first startup. However, you
will have one more process running all of the time (although sleeping).
Starting NewsCache in standalone mode allows you specify some additional
configuration options.  Usually, you start a service (NewsCache in this
case) as standalone server, if it is accessed frequently or, if you need
one of the additional configuration options.

   If you are running NewsCache as standalone server, you should also
specify the port where NewsCache should listen for NNTP connections and
a pid file where NewsCache stores its pid. The port name may be one of
the well known ports (usually listed in `/etc/services') or a port
number prepended by the `#'-sign.

     ServerType standalone
     CachePort nntp
     PidFile /var/run/NewsCache.pid

   If NewsCache is started as standalone server, the maximum number of
connections can be specified using the `MaxConnections' command.
Whenever a new client connects when this limit is reached, it will
receive a `400 too many users' response and the connection will be
closed afterwards.

     MaxConnections 16

   If you start NewsCache as standalone server with a port below 1024,
you have to start NewsCache as root. However, NewsCache will switch the
user and groupname as soon as it has bound to the socket. The Username
and Groupname options specify the user and group to switch to.  If
NewsCache is started by inetd, you should set the username in
inetd.conf and repeat it in `newscache.conf' as shown above.

     Username news
     Groupname news

   If NewsCache cannot determine your hostname, you must specify your
hostname using the `Hostname' directive.
     Hostname my.host.name

   You also should set the email-address of the person responsible for
this installation of NewsCache.  This address will be displayed in the
help message displayed by NNTP's `HELP' command.

     Admin you@your.provider

   Timeouts for the retrieval of the active database and the description
(*In version 0.99.13, the retrieval of the newsgroup descriptions is
not implemented*) of the newsgroups are set with the `Timeouts' command
(The values are given in seconds). The values indicate the time, when
NewsCache reloads the active database or the description of the
newsgroups. While the active database changes rather frequently, the
description for newsgroups changes seldomly. I recommend to use a value
around 5 minutes for the active database and a value around 1 day for
the newsgroup descriptions.

   With `ClientTimeout' you can specify an inactivity timer. If the
client does not send any commands for this time, the connection is
closed by the server. A useful value is around 15 minutes. Values below
3 minutes should not be used because that would violate the current NNTP
draft specification.

     Timeouts 300 86400
     ClientTimeout 900

   The directory for the spool area of NewsCache is set using the
`SpoolDirectory' command.  The size in KiloBytes of the spool area can
be set with with the `SpoolSize' directive.  Usually, the spool area
should be big enough to store the most frequently used newsgroups.
NewsCache itself does not perform article replacement.  This is done by
the the `NewsCacheClean' program which should be run every few hours by
crond. `NewsCacheClean' removes newsgroups until the used diskspace is
below `SpoolSize'.

   *Before starting NewsCache, check that this directory exists and
that NewsCache has read and write permissions. Additionally, this
directory must be on a local partition! NewsCache uses file locking and
does not make use of lockd. Mounting this directory via NFS would
decrease performance, so it does not make sense anyway.*

     SpoolDirectory /lhome/newscache/NSpool
     SpoolSize 100000

   NewsCache supports two different log-facilities. a) it can log
messages using syslogd (the default) and b) it can use its own log
files. This has to be configured, when building NewsCache. If you
prefer log files, use the `--without-syslog' when configuring
NewsCache. For detailed build instructions see the INSTALL and README
files.

   If you are using log files you have to set the log directory using
the `LogDirectory' command. If you are using syslogd, this statement
has no effect. *Before starting NewsCache, check that this directory
exists and that NewsCache has read and write permissions.*

     LogDirectory /lhome/newscache/log

   NewsCache supports several log styles. A host accessing NewsCache
can be logged with its IP-address (`ip-address'), its (`hostname'), or
both. NewsCache uses the same log format as INN and some additional log
entries. If you want to log only INN style log messages, add the
`strict-inn' option. This will be only useful if you use some statistic
tools for INN that get confused with those extra messages. *In version
0.99.13 `strict-inn' is only supported on the LOG_NOTICE level.*

     LogStyle ip-address strict-inn

   Whenever a News Server closes the connection, NewsCache retries to
connect to the News Server and to issue the command again. After a
certain number of retries, NewsCache gives up.

     Retries 3

   The file that lists all those newsgroups that have to be prefetched
is set by the `PrefetchFile'-directive.

     PrefetchFile /lhome/newscache/etc/prefetch


File: NewsCache.info,  Node: ServerList Option,  Next: Access Control,  Prev: General Options,  Up: Top

ServerList Configuration
************************

   The list of News Servers to be used is specified using the
`NewsServerList' command.  The command's syntax is as follows:

     NewsServerList := "NewsServerList" "{" serverlist "}"
     serverlist := | "Server" hostname port "{" optionlist "}" serverlist
     optionlist := | option optionlist
     option := "Read" grouplist | "PostTo" grouplist |
               "User" string | "Password" string
               "GroupTimeout" number | "Options" flags

   In the following example, all articles are cached, read from and
posted to the news server `news.tuwien.ac.at'.  When a client accesses a
newsgroup older than 180 seconds, NewsCache checks whether new articles
arrived on its upstream news server.

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 180
         Options cached
       }
     }

   The arguments given to the `Server'-directive are the name of your
news server followed by its port, followed by the per-server
configuration options. The per-server configuration options are:

`Read'
     indicates which newsgroups should be read from the news server. Its
     argument is  a comma separated list of newsgroup names. Each
     newsgroup name may have the `*' at its end indicating any sequence
     of characters.

`PostTo'
     indicates which articles should be posted to the news server. Its
     argument has the same syntax as the argument of the `Read'-option.
     All articles posted to one or more of these newsgroups will be
     sent to that news server.

`GroupTimeout'
     after that amount of seconds the newsgroup's active database is
     requested anew.

`User'
     If authentication is required by the upstream news server, use this
     option to specify the username that should be used.

`Password'
     If authentication is required by the upstream news server, use this
     option to specify the password for the above mentioned username.

`Options'
     gives one or more of the following options: `not-offline'--contact
     the upstream news server whenever necessary; `offline'--never
     contact the upstream news server; `semioffline'--contact the
     upstream news server whenever necessary, except for retrieving the
     list of newsgroups; `not-setpostflag', `setpostflag';
     `not-cached', `cached'.

`Commands'
     This option indicates which commands are (or are not) supported by
     the upstream news server. Some versions of the netscape collabra
     server do not support the `OVER' command correctly.  If you are
     connecting to such a news server, you might want to specify
     `not-over' here.

   The configuration of the news server(s) depends on your application
domain. The following sections present and discuss different
NewsCache-configurations.

Reducing the Load of a News Server
==================================

   If you just want to reduce the load caused by news reading clients,
you set up NewsCache with your news server as its feed and let all the
clients read news from NewsCache. The server configuration can be as
simple as in the following example because you have only one news server
where newsgroups are read from and all the articles are posted to.

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 180
         Options cached
       }
     }

Local Newsgroups
================

   NewsCache can be configured to provide transparent access to local
newsgroups. For this configuration you have to setup a small news server
holding all your local newsgroups and let NewsCache multiplex betwenn
these two news servers.

   Assume that our primary news server is `news.tuwien.ac.at' as in the
example above and that the news server holding our local newsgroups is
located at `news.infosys.tuwien.ac.at'.  In this case our server
configuration looks as follows:

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 180
         Options cached
       }
       Server news.infosys.tuwien.ac.at #120 {
         Read at.tuwien.infosys.*
         PostTo at.tuwien.infosys.*
         GroupTimeout 120
         Options not-cached
       }
     }

   The newsgroups starting with at.tuwien.infosys.* are retrieved from
our local news server and the others from `news.tuwien.ac.at'. With the
statements above all the newsgroups from our primary news server
beginning with `at.tuwien.infosys.' are eliminated.  Even those that do
not appear on our local news servers.  This behavior is intended
because newsgroups are added and deleted rather frequently and otherwise
it would be difficult to say which newsgroup comes from which news
server.

   The matching of newsgroup-names is based on the longest match. For
instance if the newsgroup configuration of our primary news server is
`*,at.tuwien.infosys.tuwien.general' than
`at.tuwien.infosys.tuwien.general' would be retrieved from our primary
news server.

   The `not-cached' option indicates that articles requested from our
local news server must now be cached. Caching these articles is
pointless because our local news server is not that much loaded and has
a good connection to our local news server. In fact they are located on
the same machine.

   *Whether the cached/not-cached flag is supported depends on your
installation. If you configured NewsCache at compile time with the
`--enable-notcached' flag this flag is supported, otherwise not. This
is disabled by default due to problems of gcc-2.7.2.  If you are using
egcs or gcc-2.8.1, you can turn on this flag safely.*

Replacing a Leaf Node News Server
=================================

   NewsCache can also be used to replace leaf node news servers. The
advantages are clear: The cache server retrieves articles on demand
only. Thus fewer disk space and CPU performance is sufficient because
the news database is smaller.

   Below, you can find a sample configuration file:

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 120
         Options cached
       }
       Server starnews.stardivision.de nntp {
         Read stardivision.*
         PostTo stardivision.*
         GroupTimeout 180
         Options cached,semioffline
       }
       NoServer {
         Read alt.binaries.*,another.hierarchy.*
         PostTo alt.binaries.*
       }
     }

   In this example, we read all groups except `stardivison.*',
`alt.binaries.*', and `another.hierarchy.*' from `news.tuwien.ac.at'.
All postings, except for `stardivision.*' and `alt.binaries.*' are
posted to `news.tuwien.ac.at'.  All articles being retrieved from any
news server are cached.

   All of these configurations are already explained in the previous
section except for `semioffline'. This option indicates that the active
database should not be retrieved from this news server. In that case it
has to be retrieved seperately using `updatenews'.

   Explain this option in more detail. Why it is useful (servers with
slow link)...

Offline Mode
============

   In the case, you cannot (or do not want to) have a permanent
connection to your news server, you must operate NewsCache in offline
mode. This is usually the case if you have some sort of dial-up
networking. Two types of offline operation modes are possible:

  1. You tell NewsCache that it must never try to contact its news
     server.

  2. NewsCache may contact the news server, but fails because no
     network is available.

   If you use some sort of dial on demand solution like diald, you have
to use the first solution. Otherwise, it depends on your preferences.
The second solution has the advantage that users can access all
newsgroups, when the connection to your provider is active. However, the
disadvantage is additional overhead because NewsCache will try to
connect to the news server, whenever a newsgroup times out.

   Assume, that we chose the first approach because we have diald
installed. Here is a sample news server configuration for this case.
Since we are reading news from different news servers, we want
NewsCache to do the multiplexing for us.

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 180
         Options offline
       }
       Server news.wu-wien.ac.at nntp {
         Read at.wu-wien.*
         PostTo .none.
         GroupTimeout 300
         Options offline not-setpostflag
       }
     }

   The first Server definition indicates your primary news server. The
news server at Technische Universität Wien. The GroupTimeout directive
is ignored in offline and semioffline mode.

   The secondary news server is `news.wu-wien.ac.at'. However, from our
provider (TU Wien), we are not allowed to post on this news server. So
posting is switched off by specifying `.none.' for the `PostTo'
newsgroup pattern. Postings to those newsgroups will also be handled by
news.tuwien.ac.at because some of the at.wu-wien groups are also
available from news.tuwien.ac.at. This is the reason, why we set the
`not-setpostflag'. Otherwise the posting flag of all the at.wu-wien
groups would be set to `n' (=forbidden) since we do not have permission
to submit postings to that server.

   Since the configuration options prohibit NewsCache to retrieve News
from `news.tuwien.ac.at' or `news.wu-wien.ac.at', we have to fetch the
newsgroups we are interested to read manually.  This is done with the
`updatenews' program which retrieves all newsgroups listed in your
`prefetch'-file.

Different Configuration for Newsgroups on same News Server
==========================================================

   It is possible to have different configurations for different
newsgroups on the same news server. The trick is to list one server
several times--each time with a different set of newsgroups.

   The example below shows a configuration, where the local newsgroups
are updated every 60 seconds and all the other groups every 15 minutes.
The reason to do is obvious. Over 90% of postings to the at.* groups are
posted to news.tuwien.ac.at. While most of the postings to the other
groups are not posted directly to news.tuwien.ac.at. Since our news
server does not permanently check for new articles on its news feed, it
makes no sense to request those articles every minute.

     NewsServerList {
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read *
         PostTo *
         GroupTimeout 900
         Options offline
       }
       Server news.tuwien.ac.at nntp {
         Read at.tuwien.*
         PostTo .none.
         GroupTimeout 60
         Options semioffline
       }
     }

   In the current implementation, the configuration as shown above has a
slight disadvantage, if the group descriptions are not disjunct. The
active database will be requested twice from news.tuwien.ac.at. In our
case for all newsgroups, with all the at.tuwien.* groups eliminated and
once for all the at.tuwien.* groups. If the news server does not support
the `list active [wildmat]' command, the *whole* active database will
be requested twice.  While this does not matter for a news server with
a good connection to the cache, you will think twice reconsider your
choice if the connection is not that good.

   Whether `list active [wildmat]' is supported by your news server can
be found out by connecting with telnet to the news server on port NNTP.
As soon as the news server welcomes you, you type `list active
comp.*<RET>'. If the server replies with `215 ...' and a list of
newsgroups, it is supported, otherwise your server does not support it.

     $ telnet news.tuwien.ac.at nntp
     200 news.tuwien.ac.at InterNetNews...
     list active comp.*
     215 Newsgroups in form "group high low flags".

Access Control
**************

   Access Control is implemented using libwrap (the same mechanism as
used by `tcpd'). However, NewsCache has to be compiled with libwrap
(This is done automatically, if it is found on your system). libwrap
allows to sepcify hosts that are allowed or denied from accessing
NewsCache in `/etc/hosts.allow' or `/etc/hosts.deny'. The service name
is `NewsCache'.

   If users from `news.tuwien.ac.at' and the domain `bad.guy.com'
should be blocked from accessing NewsCache, the `hosts.deny' should
include the following line.

     NewsCache: news.tuwien.ac.at, .bad.guy.com

   For detailed information, please consult the `libwrap',
`hosts.allow', `hosts.deny' manual pages.

Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

Where can I get NewsCache?
     You can can get NewsCache from its
     homepage (http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/NewsCache/).

What is the latest version of NewsCache?
     As of this writing the latest version is 0.99.13. The latest
     version of NewsCache can always be found at its
     homepage (http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/NewsCache/).

How does this compare to NNTPCACHE?
     NNTPCACHE is a cache server similar to NewsCache. Features of
     NewsCache are offline news reading and a cleanly designed class
     hierarchy, which is easily extendible. It provides classes for
     accessing news from a news server and base classes for
     implementing a news server tailored to user needs.

How can I contribute to the development of NewsCache?
     Volunteers are always welcome! Simply send an email to
     tom@infosys.tuwien.ac.at. I am sure that we will find something
     interesting for you.

Does it have any concept of expiry of articles?
     At the moment, NewsCache expires articles on a per newsgroup basis.
     This degrades the hit rate of NewsCache only slightly as long as
     the most frequently read newsgroups fit into the spool area. With
     the current implementation, expiry on a per article basis would be
     too inefficient, since this requires an index of all the articles.
     An index with all the articles and thus article replacement on a
     per article basis should be finished around January.

Which newsgroups are returned by the list commands?
     The list command will return those newsgroups from the news
     server(s) that match the newsgroup descriptions of the Server
     directives.

Why does the list command return more than the configured newsgroups?
     Whenever you change the set of newsgroups to be retrieved from the
     news server(s), you should remove the active database. Simply type
     rm /path/to/news/spool/.active. This is not done automatically.

I do not get any logging messages?
     NewsCache uses either syslog or log files (depending on the
     compile time configuration). For syslog, you should include a line
     similar to: news.info /var/log/news/newslog For a detailed
     explanation, see man syslog.conf.

When I start my news reader it takes several seconds before I can
     read news.  Many news readers request the active database or a
     list of new newsgrousp when starting up. The latter is implemented
     by the former in NewsCache which may take more time. If your news
     reader issues only a request for new newsgroups it will take
     substantially longer when you use NewsCache. In this situation set
     the timeout for the active database to once a week or even higher.
     If the news reader does not request the active database, it uses
     another mean for requesting the number of articles in each group
     (E.g., netscape issues the group command for each newsgroup).

Inside NewsCache
****************

   The source code of NewsCache is structured as follows:

`src/Config*'
     reads and stores the general configuration options.

`NServer/MPList*'
     responsible for storing per server configuration options.

`NServer/*'
     handles all the news databases and the communication with News
     Servers.

`NServer/NServer*'
     the logic to retrieve information from different servers (LServer
     for retrieving information from the local database; RServer for
     retrieving articles from a remote News Server; CServer an RServer
     with caching functionality)

`NVClasses/*'
     the basic database routines.

`src/NewsCache.cc'
     responsible for interacting with news readers.

   This will help you to look around. If you have questions, send email.
